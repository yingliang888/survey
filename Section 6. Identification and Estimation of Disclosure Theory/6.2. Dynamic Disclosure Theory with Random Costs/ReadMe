6.2 Dynamic Disclosure Theory with Random Costs

This section estimates the main model in Bertomeu, Marinovic, and Ma (2020). 

1.	Data preparation.

The estimation requires data on management forecast and realized earnings. The actual data preparation can be found on Appendix C in the paper. The final dataset “data.csv” used in the estimation should contain four columns: Firm ID, Year ID, Management Forecast (Missing is treated as empty), and Realized Earnings. 

2.	Estimation.

Wrapper.m: this is the main file in the estimation. The file calls in data, define likelihood function, and looks for the optimal sets of estimates.
Getpnd.m: this function calculates the threshold of firm value of which managers are indifferent between disclose and not disclose, using Equation 6.11 in the survey. 
Lik.m: this function calculates the loglikelihood given parameter values, using Equations 6.12 – 6.15.
